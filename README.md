# Mail-Sender


## Installation

All the libraries used are in the Anaconda package.


## Project Motivation

The main purpose of this project was sending e-mails based on an excel file for a certification on an online class. The code was made to be functional for other purposes as well, it reads the excel dataframe and fill the gaps in the mail body with information from it. It also attaches a pdf file.


## How to use

It is necessary to change the body of the mail as well as what columns are used in excel and the name of the pdf attached. In my case the files had the same name as the excel column 'Name', but without utf-8 formating, so I had to adapt the code.
